    <p>Hello! We are Amish, Arwen, and Suki, and we are undergraduates at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
       We are conducting a policy analysis on current book bans and censorship laws in the state of
       North Carolina, discussing the impact of these laws on students, and proposing an alternative policy: A “Freedom to Read” act. </p>

      <h3> Suki </h3>
      <p>My name is Suki, and I am from Guangzhou, China. I read The Kite Runner in Chinese and I am shocked to hear that this book
         is being banned in some part of the U.S. This book is important because what happened to Amir and Hassan demonstrated the 
         themes that we encounter everyday, such as friendships, loyalty, redemption, and fatherhood. </p>

      <h3>Arwen</h3>
      <p>Hi! My name is Arwen. I was born just outside of Dallas, Texas, and I moved to Chicago in 2019. One of my favorite
         books of all time is The Poet X by Elizabeth Acevedo. The Poet X has been banned in Florida and Virginia, and is 
         currently being challenged in North Carolina.  The collection of poems illustrates a powerful story about art, self-expression,
          identity, body image, love, and family. I have read this book easily half a dozen times, and I find new meaning and insights each time. </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "intro">
      <h3> Amishi</h3>
      <p> I'm Amishi and I have spent most of my schooling here in North Carolina. One of my favorite books is Aristotle and Dante discover the Secrets of
        the Universe by Benjamin Alire. It is important because it follows a young, queer couple of color, something that we don't see represented a lot.  </p>
