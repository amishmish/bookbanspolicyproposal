  <h2> Freedom To Read</h2>

  <div id: ftrbody>

  <p>We propose that North Carolina enact a Freedom to Read act, based on the law passed in Illinois, 
    that has since inspired a similar policy in California and others currently under consideration in Minnesota,
     Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.</p>

    <br>

    <p>“Freedom to read” describes one’s freedom to access and read any books, articles, stories, and media they wish. 
    It is tightly entwined with the first amendment, which protects the right to free press. Freedom to read acts prohibit 
    state and local governments from dictating which books are available to the public. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Freedom to Read acts also directly counteract censorship. The law requires libraries to meet an established 
    set of anti-censorship guidelines in order to receive state funding. This means that libraries cannot omit certain
     voices from their collections. Books cannot be removed from shelves on the basis of the author’s origin, race, gender, LGBTQ
      identity, religion, or personal beliefs.</p>
