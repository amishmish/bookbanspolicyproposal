    <p> &emsp; In recent times, book bans have grown a lot. Nationally, there are 
      3361 book bans that were put into place from 2022- 2023. That is just in one year.
       There are surely hundreds if not thousands of more book bans placed in this year as well. 
       The most book bans have been placed in Florida, with over a thousand bans. In this graph: </p>

    <p>&emsp; We can see that NC is also one of the states placing a lot of bans, amongst others. When we compare the data from last year

    <p>&emsp; more and more states have started implementing book bans. With NC specifically, we can see that we have added
       a number of book bans throughout the state since last year, when we had implemented none. Seeing this change in the 
       limitations we have set for our children, we can see that book bans are going to be a big part of the issues concerning 
       education in future years. But first, let us see the current policies we have made surrounding book bans.

      <p>&emsp; In North Carolina, the issue of book bans falls under broader laws governing educational materials and
         public education policies. The authority to determine which books are included or excluded from school libraries 
         often lies with local school boards, guided by guidelines set forth under statutes such as Chapter 115C-Elementary
          and Secondary Education. To be more specific, section 115C-98 deals with the selection and provision of textbooks and 
          supplementary materials. However, it seems that book bans are becoming more serious, especially on books on race, 
          sexuality, and gender identity.
