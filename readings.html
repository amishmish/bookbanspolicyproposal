  <h3> Critical Race Theory - Yosso</h3>
  <p>Yosso highlights that the experiences of marginalized communities are omitted from mainstream narratives. She says
    “CRT recognizes that the experimental knowledge of People of Color is legitimate, appropriate, and critical to understanding, 
    analyzing and teaching about racial subordination.” This means that education must include the experiences of people of color.
    Book bans frequently target literature that focuses on marginalized perspectives. For example, LGBTQ+ identities, or
    histories of oppression. By banning these books, institutions reinforce the dominant narratives that CRT seeks to challenge. Yosso
     highlights the commitment to  justice and equity in education (social justice), while book bans often target materials that
      address systemic racism, promote equity, or encourage critical thinking about historical and social power dynamics. These
       bans limits students' access to a fuller understanding of society.</p>
  <p>
    Also, Yosso talks about Community Cultural Wealth, however book bans often prevent students from engaging with these diverse
    knowledge and cultural assets, undermining their ability to see their own cultural wealth reflected in educational materials.
    This perpetuates a dominant-culture-focused curriculum and devalues the lived experiences of students from non-dominant
    backgrounds.
