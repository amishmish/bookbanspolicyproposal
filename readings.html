  <p>In her journal article "Whose culture has capital? A critical race theory discussion of community cultural wealth", Tara J Yosso discusses
     that the experiences of marginalized communities are omitted from mainstream narratives. She says
    “CRT recognizes that the experimental knowledge of People of Color is legitimate, appropriate, and critical to understanding, 
    analyzing and teaching about racial subordination.” This means that education must include the experiences of people of color.
    Book bans frequently target literature that focuses on marginalized perspectives. For example, LGBTQ+ identities, or
    histories of oppression. By banning these books, institutions reinforce the dominant narratives that CRT seeks to challenge. Yosso
     highlights the commitment to  justice and equity in education (social justice), while book bans often target materials that
      address systemic racism, promote equity, or encourage critical thinking about historical and social power dynamics. These
       bans limits students' access to a fuller understanding of society.</p>
  <p>
    Also, Yosso talks about Community Cultural Wealth, which describes the unique assets that student of colors bring to the classroom. 
    However book bans often prevent students from engaging with these diverse
    knowledge and cultural assets, undermining their ability to see their own cultural wealth reflected in educational materials.
    This perpetuates a dominant-culture-focused curriculum and devalues the lived experiences of students from non-dominant
    backgrounds.

  <p>Carol Lee suggests in her book "The Culture of Everyday Practices" that educators should use cultural tools (e.g., storytelling 
  traditions, community narratives) to help students 
  engage with academic concepts. Many banned books provide precisely the kind of cultural and narrative tools that allow teachers 
  to create meaningful connections between students’ everyday lives and academic learning. By banning books, students of color miss out 
  on representations and connection to their cultures, preventing teachers from being able to use these cutlural tools to support them. By 
  banning books, legislatures create a hostile environment for students of color and intimidate teachers into not using these culutural tools.

  <p>In her Ted Talk, Dr. Love illustrates the importance of centering diverse stories and skills. She uses the example of hip-hop
    as a way to learn about art, storytelling, and Black history. Dr. Love also stresses the importance of not only teaching students
    to embrace and utilize their unique strengths, but simultaneously teaching them about racism and obstacles they will encounter 
    in their lives. She empowers students to learn from one another’s experiences. Book bans and censorship actively hinder student’s
    abilities to learn from those who are different from them, and prevent educators from fully engaging with students' history and
    culture.
